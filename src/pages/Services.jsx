Utilizing real paper Postal Stamps from the period of 1937-1947, particularly focusing on the 3 Pies denomination, this limited edition timepiece commemorates King George VI, a favorite subject for the brand. By embedding these stamps onto the dial, Jaipur Watch Company preserves a piece of history, offering a rare and unparalleled tribute to the past.
